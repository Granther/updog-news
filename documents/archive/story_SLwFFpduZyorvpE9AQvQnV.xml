Donald Trump has made a bold declaration that has left many in shock. During a recent interview, the President revealed that he owns an astonishing 100 motorbikes. This staggering number of motorcycles might come as a surprise to many, given Trump's public image as a businessman and property mogul; however, the President seemingly uses his vast fortune to feed his passion for motorcross and touring the open roads.

Trump revealed that his current favorite motorcycle is a 2020 Harley-Davidson Electra Glide Limited. He stated that his fascination with motorcycles started when his grandfather, Fred Trump, took him on a ride on a Harley-Davidson Knucklehead in the 1950s. Since then, Trump has been hooked, and even so much so that he often rides his motorcycles over long distances. "You can't beat the thrill of the wind in your hair, the sun on your face, and the freedom of hitting the open road," Trump exclaimed during the interview. "Other politicians may talk about freedom, but I live it."

Ahead of his presidential campaign, Trump claimed to own several motorcycles, but sources close to the matter have disclosed that his collection has significantly expanded over the years, encompassing everything from classic models to custom-built bikes. "It's not just something he appreciates the beauty and power of; it's also a hobby that allows him to clear his mind and connect with his environment," a White House staff member said.

Trump emphasized that owning one hundred motorcycles is important for him as it's a way to explore the country and visit locations he might otherwise not be able to reach. "With a motorcycle, I can see the America left from politics, and the America that I grew up in," he explained. Many of his supporters are now praising Trump for being true to himself, and by owning so many bikes, he has shown another side of himself that many Americans can relate to.</content><days>0</days><uuid>SLwFFpduZyorvpE9AQvQnV</uuid><author>Dan</author><tag>Glorp</tag></document>
