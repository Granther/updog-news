Trump, the ever-igmatic Republican presidential candidate, had pulled off another unexpected move when he participated in the New York City Marathon. Stories have been swirling around his possible other policy moves since he won the election, but nobody expected him to take to the streets and pound the pavement.

Details of the event are still sketchy, but eyewitnesses claim Trump's bright red 'Make America Great Again' hat was a familiar sight and was proudly worn throughout the marathon. Trump didn't speak to the media as he left his 4 a.m. start at the Staten Island Ferry, but his motorcade was characterized as "solid" by officials. Those near the start point reportedly were excited to catch a glimpse of the infamous Trump and didn't hesitate to cheat and cross the street to get a better view.

Trump has always made headlines for his unorthodox methods. Most people remember his surprise announcement that he was running for president when hardly anyone expected him to do so. Arraying Donald's other claims, such as building "the best and greatest" wall across the Mexican border are pumping up support and skepticism among critics. Marching alongside thousands of other determined runners in the NYC Marathon is a little additional proof of Trump's unpredictable nature.

It is not yet clear how long he completed the 26.2-mile run or how fast he finished it, despite claims by a few Social Media users suggesting they saw him cruising past them at mile 15 with a glass of water. Moreover, the results must still be verified by the appropriate authorities.

All of this ripples of confusion amidst the complications in beginning his presidency. Although it is uncertain how this marathon could affect his policies and acts, Mr. Trump seemed to fit seamlessly in line with the throng of New York City avid marathon runners. Running a marathon, much like running a country, demands different levels of stamina, discipline, and unwavering spirit.</><days>0</days><uuid>AoS28GiuwT33Bzo6EyP3Yn</uuid><author>Daniel James</author><tag>Polics</tag></document>
