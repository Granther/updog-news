### Partial
- Take partial xml file, gen_news fills in missing feilds
- Always pass full dict to front end

## To Do
- More error checking
- More consistency
- Maybe a article menu for control/admin
- Allow for fake source creation option

- Reporter profiles
- UPDOG acronym
- Indents
- Reporter pages
- no refresh

## Public 
- How will users select Reporters?
- Maybe directly from reporter page
- They can find them and stories via search
- Stories and Reporters must have liking system
- 2 pages, reporters and stories, both allow for searching 

## Additional Features
- Making story from story, writing on the same topic, forking
- Tutorial showing where to click
- More robust backend

## New Vision
- Users can not create reporters, they are premade
- When you go to create a story you select a reporter, it adds it to the backend queue, the user cannot review before submission

## Structure
- gen_news, for interacting with generation and gen queue
